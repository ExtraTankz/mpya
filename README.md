# 
# MPYA Application

A Weather program called MPYA, aka 'My Python App', Very generic I know but it is my first program made in python!




## Usage/Examples

    Note, this program requires a file called "API.MPYA",
    this file should contain all the API keys!
    Read through the script for more information.
    I use major.minor.subsidiary Versioning, Not exactly major.minor.patch but similar.
    it goes like: Big change with errors likely,
        Smaller change with less errors and more just features,
        Very small change such as removing a single file or editting a couple letters.
